# 👋 ¡Hola! I'm Fernando Ruiz

Welcome to my little corner of the internet — where elegant code meets pragmatic chaos, usually at 2AM with a cup of coffee in hand and a Pedro Pascal voiceover in my head.

## 🧠 Who I Am  
I'm a seasoned Software Engineer from Mexico City with **17 years of experience** building scalable systems, shipping secure code, and solving messy problems with clean logic.

By day, I write Ruby like poetry. By night, I study Mathematics just *because I can*.

## 🛠️ What I Do  

🔭 **Currently at 🐞 [Bugcrowd](https://www.bugcrowd.com/)** — shipping secure systems with Ruby on Rails, and occasionally sprinkling some Kotlin here and there.

📍 **Previously built cool stuff at:**

- 🏪 [Digital FEMSA](https://www.femsa.com/es/unidades-de-negocio/digital-femsa/)

## 💻 Tech Stack I Love  
These are my go-to tools for building and scaling software:

- **Languages & Frameworks:**  
  Ruby on Rails · Elixir · Phoenix · Java · Spring · JavaScript · Node.js

- **Databases & APIs:**  
  PostgreSQL · GraphQL · gRPC

- **Others I'm always exploring:**  
  Nix · Terraform · Kafka · Docker · Anything with a REPL and a challenge

## 🌱 Currently Growing  
- Learning **German** 🇩🇪 (wish me luck with those compound words)  
- Earning a **Bachelor’s in Mathematics** from UNADM
